# Painting Generator ‚Äî JavaFX Standalone Application  
**Avans Hogeschool ‚Äì Bachelor Year 1**  
**Assessment Project: Java & JavaFX**

---

## üé® Project Overview  
This application was developed as an individual assessment project in the first year of the bachelor‚Äôs program at Avans University of Applied Sciences.  
The goal was to build a **standalone JavaFX application** that demonstrates a broad range of GUI and file interaction features.

The app simulates a generative art tool where users can build a "painting" by adding trees to a canvas. It includes interactivity, animations, custom layout management, and file export/import functionality.

## üñºÔ∏è Application Features  
- Add **two different types of trees** to the canvas  
- Add **100 random trees** with one click  
- **Clear** the canvas with a reset button  
- **Play mode**: animate the painting in a loop  
- **Export** the current painting to a file  
- **Import** a previously saved painting  
- A **signature** is displayed in the bottom-right corner, with a dropdown to change its **font style**  
- Utilizes a **JavaFX menu bar**, and various layout managers like `VBox`, `HBox`, and `Pane`

## üß† Learning Objectives  
This project was focused on applying the following JavaFX concepts:

- Event-driven programming with buttons and menus  
- Drawing and animating custom shapes (e.g., trees made of circles/rectangles)  
- JavaFX layout structures and scene organization  
- File I/O for saving and loading state  
- Timeline-based animations and scene transitions  
- JavaFX styling and font control

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **Java 17+**  
- **JavaFX** (UI and graphics)  
- **File I/O** (import/export painting)  
- **OOP principles** (tree types, modular design)  
- **FXML** was *not* used; everything was built programmatically

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run  
1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse**  
2. Ensure JavaFX is correctly configured in your IDE  
3. Set the main class (e.g., `Main.java`) as the entry point  
4. Run the project ‚Äî the application window should open

You could also run it from the terminal.
